        <p>The people of Japan believe that everyone has an ikigai – a reason to jump out of bed each morning.</p>
        <p> And according to the residents of the Japanese island of Okinawa – the world’s longest-living people –
            finding it is the key to a longer and more fulfilled life.</p>

        <p>What you love and what you can be paid for becomes your <b><i>profession</i></b></p>
        <p>What you can be paid for and what the world needs becomes your <b><i>vocation</i></b></p>
        <p>What the world needs and what you love becomes your <b><i>mission</i></b></p>

        <h2>The ten rules of ikigai are-</h2>
        <p><b><i>1) Stay active, don't retire</i></b>-Keep doing what you love</p>
        <p><b><i>2) Take it slow</i></b>- When you leave urgency behind, life and time take a new meaning</p>
        <p><b><i>3) Dont't fill your stomach</i></b>- Less is more when it comes to a long life. Eat a little less than your hunger demands.</p>
        <p><b><i>4) Surround yourself with good friends</i></b>- Friends are the best medicine, there for confiding, sharing stories, getting advice, having fun, dreaming, in other words for living.</p>
        <p><b><i>5) Get in shape for your next birthday</i></b>- The body you move through life needs a bit of gentle daily maintenance.</p>
        <p><b><i>6) Smile</i></b>- It's a priviledge to be here and now- in a world full of so many possibilites. So, smile.</p>
        <p><b><i>7) Reconnect with nature</i></b>- Human beings are made to be a part of the natural world. Return to it as often as you can.</p>
        <p><b><i>8) Give thanks</i></b>- Give thanks for everything that brightens your days and makes you feel lucky to be alive.</p>
        <p><b><i>9) Live in the moment</i></b>- Today is all we have. Make it worth remembering.</p>
        <p><b><i>10) Find your ikigai</i></b></p>
